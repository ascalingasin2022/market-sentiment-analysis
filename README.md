# 📊 Market Sentiment Analysis

This is a simple Streamlit project that analyze market sentiment from CSV files.  
Basically, you upload a CSV with text about stocks, tweets, or market news, and it will calculate sentiment scores, display charts, and show detailed results in a table.

### Option 3: Run using the Windows `.bat` file

If you are on Windows, you can run the app using the included `.bat` file. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ascalingasin2022/market-sentiment-analysis.git
cd market-sentiment-analysis
```

2. **Install dependencies** (if not done already):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Run the app** by double-clicking the `run_demo.bat` file inside the project folder.
   This will automatically open the Streamlit app in your default browser.

> Make sure Python is installed and added to your PATH before running the `.bat` file.

## CSV Format

Your CSV **must** have a `text` column.
Optional columns:

* `timestamp` → If missing, the current date/time will be used.
* `symbol` → Stock or market symbol (e.g., AAPL, TSLA).

Example:

```csv
timestamp,text,symbol
2025-09-01 09:00:00,The stock is doing amazing today!,AAPL
2025-09-01 10:30:00,Investors are worried about inflation,TSLA
2025-09-02 11:00:00,This new product launch looks promising,MSFT
2025-09-02 13:15:00,The market is crashing badly,GOOG
```

If you don’t have a CSV ready, just download the **sample CSV** from the app interface.

## Output

* **Charts**:

  * Line chart for average sentiment over time.
  * Bar chart for number of entries per day.
* **Table**: Each row shows `timestamp`, `text`, `symbol`, `score`, `label` (color-coded).
* **Downloadable CSV**: Save all analyzed results.
